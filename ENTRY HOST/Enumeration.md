### Reflected XSS

Reflected XSS is a type of **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attack where an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web application. The injected script is **reflected** off the web server and executed in the victim's browser.

**How It Works**

1. **Attacker crafts a malicious URL** containing a script.
2. **Victim clicks the link** (via phishing, comments, etc.).
3. **Web server reflects the input** without sanitization.
4. **Victimâ€™s browser executes the script** (stealing cookies, session hijacking, etc.).


So, insert the following code on the search field.

```
"><script>alert('1');</script>
```

After click on the Search button you'll see a pop up window like this:
